# misp-dashboard

A dashboard showing live data and statistics from the ZMQ feeds of one or more [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/) instances.
The dashboard can be used as a real-time situational awareness tool to gather threat intelligence information.
The misp-dashboard includes a [gamification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification#Criticism) tool to show the contributions of each organisation and how they are ranked over time.
The dashboard can be used for SOCs (Security Operation Centers), security teams or during cyber exercises to keep track of what is being processed on your various MISP instances.

# Features

# Installation

Before installing, consider that the only supported system are open source Unix-like operating system such as Linux and others.

1. You will need to [create a free MaxMind account.](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup)
2. Set your password and [create a license key](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/license-key)
2.1 Make a note of your License Key it's needed during install.

- Launch ```./install_dependencies.sh``` from the MISP-Dashboard directory ([idempotent-ish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence))
- Update the configuration file ```config.cfg``` so that it matches your system
  - Fields that you may change:
    - RedisGlobal -> host
    - RedisGlobal -> port
    - RedisGlobal -> zmq_url
    - RedisGlobal -> misp_web_url
    - RedisMap    -> pathMaxMindDB

# Updating by pulling
- Re-launch ```./install_dependencies.sh``` to fetch new required dependencies
- Re-update your configuration file ```config.cfg``` by comparing eventual changes in ```config.cfg.default```

:warning: Make sure no zmq python3 scripts are running. They block the update.

```python
+ virtualenv -p python3 DASHENV
Already using interpreter /usr/bin/python3
Using base prefix '/usr'
New python executable in /home/steve/code/misp-dashboard/DASHENV/bin/python3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/virtualenv", line 9, in <module>
    load_entry_point('virtualenv==15.0.1', 'console_scripts', 'virtualenv')()
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/virtualenv.py", line 719, in main
    symlink=options.symlink)
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/virtualenv.py", line 942, in create_environment
    site_packages=site_packages, clear=clear, symlink=symlink))
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/virtualenv.py", line 1261, in install_python
    shutil.copyfile(executable, py_executable)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.5/shutil.py", line 115, in copyfile
    with open(dst, 'wb') as fdst:
OSError: [Errno 26] Text file busy: '/home/steve/code/misp-dashboard/DASHENV/bin/python3'
```
- Restart the System: `./start_all.sh` **OR** `./start_zmq.sh` and `./server.py &`

# Starting the System
:warning: You should not run it as root. Normal privileges are fine.

- Be sure to have a running redis server
    - e.g. ```redis-server --port 6250```
- Activate your virtualenv ```. ./DASHENV/bin/activate```
- Listen to the MISP feed by starting the zmq_subscriber ```./zmq_subscriber.py &```
- Start the dispatcher to process received messages ```./zmq_dispatcher.py &```
- Start the Flask server ```./server.py &```
- Access the interface at ```http://localhost:8001/```

__Alternatively__, you can run the ```start_all.sh``` script to run the commands described above.

# Authentication
Authentication can be enable in ``config/config.cfg`` by setting ``auth_enabled = True``.
Users will be required to login to MISP and will be allowed to proceed if they have the *User Setting*'s ``dashboard_access`` sets to 1 for the MISP user account.

# Debug

Debug is fun and gives you more details on what is going on when things fail.
Bare in mind running Flask in debug is NOT suitable for production, it will drop you to a Python shell if enabled, to do further digging.

Just before running ./server.py do:

```
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
export FLASK_APP=server.py
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8001 # <- Be careful here, this exposes it on ALL ip addresses. Ideally if run locally --host=127.0.0.1
```

OR, just toggle the debug flag in start_all.sh or config.cfg.

Happy hacking ;)


## Restart from scratch

To restart from scratch and empty all data from your dashboard you can use the dedicated cleaning script ``clean.py``
```usage: clean.py [-h] [-b]

Clean data stored in the redis server specified in the configuration file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  -b, --brutal  Perfom a FLUSHALL on the redis database. If not set, will use
                a soft method to delete only keys used by MISP-Dashboard.
```

## Notes about ZMQ
The misp-dashboard being stateless in regards to MISP, it can only process data that it received. Meaning that if your MISP is not publishing all notifications to its ZMQ, the misp-dashboard will not have them.

The most revelant example could be the user login punchcard. If your MISP doesn't have the option ``Plugin.ZeroMQ_audit_notifications_enable`` set to ``true``, the punchcard will be empty.

## Dashboard not showing results - No module named zmq
When the misp-dashboard does not show results then first check if the zmq module within MISP is properly installed. 

In **Administration**, **Plugin Settings**, **ZeroMQ** check that **Plugin.ZeroMQ_enable** is set to **True**.

Publish a test event from MISP to ZMQ via **Event Actions**, **Publish event to ZMQ**.

Verify the logfiles
```
${PATH_TO_MISP}/app/tmp/log/mispzmq.error.log
${PATH_TO_MISP}/app/tmp/log/mispzmq.log
```

If there's an error **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'zmq'** then install pyzmq.

```
$SUDO_WWW ${PATH_TO_MISP}/venv/bin/pip install pyzmq
```

# zmq_subscriber options
```usage: zmq_subscriber.py [-h] [-n ZMQNAME] [-u ZMQURL]

A zmq subscriber. It subscribe to a ZMQ then redispatch it to the MISP-dashboard

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n ZMQNAME, --name ZMQNAME
                        The ZMQ feed name
  -u ZMQURL, --url ZMQURL
                        The URL to connect to
```

# Deploy in production using mod_wsgi

Install Apache mod-wsgi for Python3

```bash
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3
```

Caveat: If you already have mod-wsgi installed for Python2, it will be replaced!

```bash
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  libapache2-mod-wsgi
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3
```

Configuration file `/etc/apache2/sites-available/misp-dashboard.conf` assumes that `misp-dashboard` is cloned into `/var/www/misp-dashboard`. It runs as user `misp` in this example. Change the permissions to your custom folder and files accordingly.
